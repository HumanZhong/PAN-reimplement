# PAN-reimplement
This is an unofficial pytorch re-implementation of "Efficient and Accurate Arbitrary-Shaped Text Detection with Pixel Aggregation Network"(19'ICCV,PANet/PSENet-v2) and some personal modifications.
* Thanks to the help of the official PSENet implementation[https://github.com/whai362/PSENet] and PAN.pytorch[https://github.com/WenmuZhou/PAN.pytorch]. This repo is mainly based on the PSENet repo and followed a similar framework.
* While PSENet is implemented in Python2, this repo uses Python3 to implement both PSENet and PAN. Compared to the PAN.pytorch repo, this repo fixes some bugs and achieves a higher f-score(but is still lower than the original paper by ~0.5%, sigh)

## How to train
* train on icdar 'CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python train_icdar15_PAN.py --backbone res18/res50 --lr YOUR.LR --resume YOUR.CHECKPOINT_FILE'
* train on ctw 'CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python train_ctw1500.py --backbone res18/res50 --lr YOUR.LR --resume YOUR.CHECKPOINT_FILE'
Other training scripts are variants which have external extension like top/bottom boundary prediction. You can check the codes for detailed information

## Future work & Note
* This version is just a preliminary manuscript and has not been organized well. Sorry for organizing the codes in such a messy way, I'll update a cleaner version as soon as possible.
* The detailed performance of PAN/PSE (this repo's performance has a slightly drop compared to the original PAN paper)  
* and a guide to the training process will also be uploaded soon. (done)
* If this repo really helps you, please star it, thx!
